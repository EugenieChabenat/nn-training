# if nodelist is not specified, the task will run on 
# whichever node that's available, prioritizing running 
# Issa lab's node. If our lab has no node available, the
# task will run on other lab's node as a "burst" task.
# The burst task will be forced to stop if people from 
# other labs need to use their node, and your script will
# rerun on the next available node (note that the script
# will not continue from previous states. It will simply
# rerun). So, unless your code can handle forced stops,
# it's better to run on our own nodes instead bursting 
# into other labs' nodes. If the node you specify is not
# available, the task will wait in line.
